<h3>Use fragments for configuration change</h3>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<p>If there is a need to persist data across configuaration changes (due to orientation change, font size change) it is better to use a retained fragment.</p>

<p>This example is taken from the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentRetainInstance.java">samples demo</a>:</p>

<pre><code>/**
 * This example shows how you can use a Fragment to easily propagate state
 * (such as threads) across activity instances when an activity needs to be
 * restarted due to, for example, a configuration change.  This is a lot
 * easier than using the raw Activity.onRetainNonConfiguratinInstance() API.
